# MemeMe2.0
Udacity Project: MemeMe 2.0

MemeMe 2.0 is one of the Portfolio Apps for the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It builds upon MemeMe 1.0, which used UIKit Fundamentals and showcased implementing an Image Picker and sharing, by adding implementation of a Table View and a Collection View.

## The App
MemeMe 2.0 is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. MemeMe 2.0 also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid.

## Improvements
* Impact as the default font
